# Secure Ecommerce API

## Description
This project is the result of my master thesis at Polithecnic University of Catalonia (UPC). I conducted the masters in Cybersecurity, given by the Computer Science Faculty of Barcelona (FIB) and (ETSETB).

The aim of the thesis was to develop a secure API following OWASP top ten recommendations and other Organisation standards in order to provide an example of good practices and API securisation.


## Configuration
The app is fully dockerized, and only requires a couple of `.env` files to work. The first `.env` file will be for the api application itself, and the `.env.docker` file will be for the docker-compose.yml configuration.

The api `.env` file need the following variables:
```
PORT=...

DB_PORT=...
DB_USERNAME=...
DB_PASSWORD=...
DB_HOST=...
DB_NAME=...

JWT_ALG=... // (Ex: "HS256")
JWT_EXPIRATION=...
JWT_ISSUER=...
JWT_AUDIENCE=...
JWT_SECRET=...
``` 
And the `.env.docker` file needs the following variable definitions:
```
POSTGRES_USER=...
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...

PG_SERVER_USER=...
PG_SERVER_PWD=...
PG_SERVER_DB=...
PG_SERVER_DB_SCHEMA=...
```
